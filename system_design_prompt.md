# System Design Interview Practice Prompt

I'm practicing for system design interviews. My background is in software development and site reliability engineering, with expertise in Kubernetes, Linux, and cloud technologies.

Please walk me through designing a **[INSERT SYSTEM HERE - e.g., "URL shortener", "chat system", "social media feed"]** step by step, layer by layer.

## Approach I'd Like:
- **Interactive walkthrough** where you present your solution layer by layer
- I can ask questions, suggest alternatives, or challenge decisions at each step
- Emphasize deployment architecture, cost, design tradeoffs, and observability patterns given my SRE background

## Framework to Follow:
1. **Requirements Clarification** - Functional & non-functional requirements
2. **High-Level Architecture** - Major components and data flow  
3. **Deep Dives** - Database design, API design, caching strategy
4. **Scale Considerations** - Load balancing, sharding, replication
5. **Reliability & Monitoring** - SRE patterns, observability
6. **Trade-offs Discussion** - CAP theorem implications, consistency models

## Style Preferences:
- Break down complex concepts into clear steps/components
- Include pros and cons for different approaches
- Feel free to ask clarifying questions if more context would help
- Explore both immediate solutions and alternative approaches

Please start by clarifying requirements and asking any questions you need before we begin the design.
